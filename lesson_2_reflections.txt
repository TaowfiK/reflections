What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	it makes a .git (hidden file) in my directory,and i need it for make a new project that has full control on it .

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	staging area is the component that uses our tracked files ,and the repository uses it but working directory is just the directory that carry the files itself (tracked and untracked).
	the value of that is we dont use the directory itself and this is more protectful feature.
