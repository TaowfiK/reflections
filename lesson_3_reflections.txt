When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when i want to share it with other contributers .

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  because i maynot need all of changes that happening in my remote repository or i don't need to change on my Desktop.
